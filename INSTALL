The preferred way to install this module is via cpan. If you do not have
root permissions I would suggest to have a look at the excellent
local::lib CPAN module. For manual installation run

perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

In order to use this module you need at least perl version 5.10.1. In addition
the following modules are required:

Carp
Fcntl
IO::Handle
Time::HiRes

All of these modules are part of perl core and should already be
included in your perl distribution.

Obviously Math::FORM::Simple needs a working FORM installation to be useful.
